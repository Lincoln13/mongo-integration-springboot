Integrating mongoDB with spring data

Project: mongo-integration-springboot

This project acts as a guide for establishing a connection between springboot and mongodb installed locally on your system.
This project will also help you in creating a connection with mongo db even if it is hosted on cloud, Mongo Atlas.

Just visit application.properties file of this project and change the config as per your need.

It will be a help if you could leave a comment, in case you feel something could have been done better. 
cheers!!
